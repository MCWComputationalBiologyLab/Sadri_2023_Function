# Sadri_Function_2023
This folder contains the MATLAB codes for the computational modeling of the heart and 
kidney cortex and outer medulla mitochondrial bioenergetics and respiration. The codes
are zipped into three files for three folders corresponding to heart and kidney cortex
and outer medulla. Each folder contains the subroutines of all enzymes and transporters.
Each folder also contains the MATLAB codes to generate Figures 2 and 3 of the published
manuscript in FUNCTION journal.
