# Sadri_Function_2023
This folder contains MATLAB codes for the computational models of the heart and kidney
cortex and outer medulla (OM) mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. The codes are
zipped into three files for the three folders corresponding to the heart and kidney cortex
and OM. Each folder contains subroutines for the mitochondrial enzymes and transporters.
Each folder also contains MATLAB codes to generate the Figures 2 and 3 of the published
manuscript in the FUNCTION journal.
